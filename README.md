# ZebraGraphicsConverter
In my projects I'm often using labels written direct in ZPL code. It is not a problem to create template with text, barcodes etc, but it is hard to use images.
The original description of ^GFA command is a little bit poor. Now you can use this tool to convert images to text ZPL format.
Just open picture and click convert button - if everything will be ok you will see ZPL code. Copy / paste it to you template!
It is aslo possible to open text file with ^GFA command to convert it to image.
